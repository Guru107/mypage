                    <i>As a Senior Backend Developer at Falkonry, I was involved in the design and development of several critical backend projects, significantly enhancing the
                        platform's signal management and reporting capabilities.</i>
                    <h4>Projects:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Signal Time Series Data Storage Optimisation:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed a streamlined data model for signal storage, simplifying the process by grouping
                                    signals based on their data frequency. This approach reduced storage complexity by consolidating multiple signals into a single directory,
                                    making data retrieval and analysis more straightforward.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Developed a reliable service using Python, incorporating essential libraries such as FastAPI for API routes, PyArrow for Parquet read/write
            operations, and the Pulsar client library for consuming data from topics.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Implemented a compaction module to aggregate time series data at different levels, utilizing Pandas for aggregation and data
            cleaning. This module autonomously aggregated data to various granularities, supporting aggregation levels from one minute to one day.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Improved data metadata management by updating metadata objects in MongoDB upon the arrival of raw data, ensuring accurate tracking of
            data points and facilitating efficient data retrieval.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Asset Hierarchy Project:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed and developed the data model and API to organize and manage a large volume of signals using MongoDB
                                    for storage and Scala with Akka libraries for the API layer. This project improved the efficiency of organizing and searching signals on the
                                    Falkonry platform.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Reporting System:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Developed the backend for a comprehensive reporting system that enabled the creation and visualization of time-series
                                    data reports. Leveraged existing APIs and data models to facilitate report organization and state management.
